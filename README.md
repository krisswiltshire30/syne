# Syne [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/krisswiltshire30/syne.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/krisswiltshire30/syne) <a href="https://codeclimate.com/github/krisswiltshire30/syne/maintainability"><img src="https://api.codeclimate.com/v1/badges/06a0b423c5246455d8b7/maintainability" /></a>

## Welcome to Syne!
- Have you ever wanted to see what a sphere looks like, jumping to the bass of your latest track? Look no further!
- Have you ever wanted to soar like an eagle through geometric shapes, twitching, pumping and twisting to the sound of Johann Sebastian Bach? Say no more!
- Do you like to bang on the table and watch pyramids tremble with fear? You are in the right place!

If the answer to any of the above is 'HELL YES',  then welcome!

Syne, at it's most basic operation, is an API that makes geometric shapes move to audio stimulus. 

It takes an audio input and converts the data into readable numbers, which can be used to effect the many parameters of 3D objects.

After that, the possibilities are endless.
